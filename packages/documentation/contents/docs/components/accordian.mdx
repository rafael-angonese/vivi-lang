## Accordian Intro

An accordion, in the context of web development or user interface design, is a graphical control element that allows users to expand and collapse sections of content. It typically consists of a list of headers or titles, each associated with a content panel that can be expanded or collapsed independently.

> JavaScript: because who needs type safety anyway?

When a header is clicked or activated, its associated content panel expands to reveal its contents, and when another header is clicked, the previously expanded panel collapses and the new one expands.

This interaction pattern is often used to organize and present large amounts of content in a compact and structured way, allowing users to focus on specific sections of interest while hiding the rest. Accordions are commonly used in websites for FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions), product descriptions, or any content where a hierarchical structure is beneficial.
