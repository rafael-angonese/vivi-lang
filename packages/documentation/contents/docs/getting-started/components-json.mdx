The components.json file holds configuration for your project.

We use it to understand how your project is set up and how to generate components customized for your project.

You can create a components.json file in your project by running the following command:

```
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

## $schema

You can see the JSON Schema for components.json here.

```json:components.json
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json"
}
```

## style

The style for your components. This cannot be changed after initialization.

```json:components.json
{
  "style": "default" | "new-york"
}
```

## tailwind

Configuration to help the CLI understand how Tailwind CSS is set up in your project.

See the installation section for how to set up Tailwind CSS.

tailwind.config
Path to where your tailwind.config.js file is located.

### tailwind.config

Path to where your tailwind.config.js file is located.

```json:components.json
{
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js" | "tailwind.config.ts"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.css

Path to the CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS into your project.

```json:components.json
{
  "tailwind": {
    "css": "styles/global.css"

## rsc

Whether or not to enable support for React Server Components.

The CLI automatically adds a use client directive to client components when set to true.

```json:components.json
{
  "rsc": `true` | `false`
}
```

## tsx

Choose between TypeScript or JavaScript components.

Setting this option to false allows components to be added as JavaScript with the .jsx file extension.

```json:components.json
{
  "tsx": `true` | `false`
}
```
